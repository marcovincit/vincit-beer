# Vincit Beer


<img src="assets/img/screenshot.jpg">

Vincit Beer is a gift for my clients, partners and also my friends. It was conceived to celebrate all 2015’s victories and to celebrate the arrival of 2016. It is also a tribute to the poet Publius Virgilius Maro, whose quotes served as inspiration to my last name. It represents my best wishes to everyone who’s by my side, every day, learning and achieving amazing things together.
